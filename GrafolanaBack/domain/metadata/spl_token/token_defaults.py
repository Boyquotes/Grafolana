The xSTEP represents over and above the staked amount. The staking contract distributes STEP to the token holders. The platform burns the tokens to ensure that a small number of people donâ€™t own a huge amount of token supply.  The act of transferring a token to an account that can only receive them in order to permanently remove the tokens from the supply is known as 'Burning' or 'Coin Burning' in cryptocurrency. Platform users can supply and borrow STEP tokens on the lending protocol and earn interest.",
